# Computational Finance

Some codes to do computational fincance are shown in this folder.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
For [AvellanedaLee 2009](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1153505) ,  you need a matrix ij, called A, where j is different stocks to be considered (hardwired at 471) and i is the number of observations (hardwired)

## To do

I'll be posting updates with the threshold, signals and backtesting. Signal optimization is on the way.
Remove hardwires.
